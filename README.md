# Creating an infographic on anthropogenic methane emissions in 2021

## Purpose
In this infographic, the overarching question that I will be answering is where anthropogenic methane emissions came from in 2021. This includes the countries where emissions are occurring most frequently and also the human activities (e.g., energy production, agriculture, etc.) that contribute the most to these emissions.
